## Option One: CrystalsCollector Game (Recommended)
 The player will have to use the secrect number hiden for each crystal to make the sum of these secrect numbers equal to a computer randomly generate number to win. 
 this game is used to demonstrte how well the studnet masters the new subject of the usage of jQuery and refresh the student's skills on html, CSS(Bootstrap), and javaScript.
 
 Here is how this game works:

   * There will be four crystals displayed at near the buttons on the page.

   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

     * The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
     * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

     * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * The game will should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.

side note: 
* The random number shown at the start of the game would  between 19 - 120.
* Each crystal would have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
* If you are lucky, you could win by repeatly click only one crystal.
